With our first boards soldered from last week, we were ready to get started with software development. A lot of work will need to be done on both the hub and node devices in the next few weeks, so we wanted to give Evgeny, the lead software developer, as much time as possible to work some software magic.

The first step would be to flash programs to the Atmel ATmega32U4 microcontroller. The circuitry we developed is based on the Arduino Micro, so the hope was that we could use the Arduino IDE for development as well. Unfortunately, Atmel chips are not programmed with the Arduino compatible bootloader from the factory, so we needed to find a workaround.

Using a tool called avrdude, we attempted to build our software and then flash directly to the microcontroller, using the built in USB controller on board the chip. We had some success here, but ran into all sorts of annoying bugs in programming. Programming frequently failed, and the chip regularly lost connection with our computers. Worst of all, because we were working with the Atmel bootloader without proper hardware tools, we were unable to set clock speeds or debug the device over serial communication. 

Clearly, working with the Atmel bootloader was becoming too much of a hassle, so we decided it would be faster, and easier in the long run, to simply burn the Arduino bootloader to the chip. Since we had not planned for this earlier, we needed to do just a little bit of hardware hacking in order to break out the ICSP pins of the microcontroller, using an Arduino Uno as the programmer. It wasn't pretty, but it got the job done, and now we can use the Arduino IDE.

With one problem out of the way, we promptly decided to have another problem as quickly as possible. We struggled to use our board to communicate wirelessly using the RFM69HCW transceiver, even though we were able to do so successfully on breadboards last term. At first, we thought it might be a matter of setting up interrupt pins properly on our new device, but this didn't completely solve the problem. No matter what we did, the transceiver module was only able to initialize, but was unable to transmit or receive any packets of data.

It took a few solid hours of bashing our brains together, but then we discovered the problem. The transceiver module uses the SPI protocol for communicating with our microcontroller, a protocol that involves use of a chip select line to cycle between slave devices. Since we only had the one SPI device, we figured we could fix the chip select on the transceiver module. However, it turns out the slave device itself needs to be okay with that kind of design choice, and the RFM69HCW requires the chip select line to alternate high and low in order to start/stop communications. Thus, we broke out the soldering iron again to perform just a little more hardware hacking.

With that final hardware hack, we were finally able to let out a sigh of relief Friday evening, as we watched our board successfully communicate with our other RF devices. Now, we could leave this board with Evgeny to start developing the software required for the node network. Next, we'll start validating the sensor circuitry, before placing a new order of boards in the next few weeks.
