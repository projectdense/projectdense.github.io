Symposium week is here! The DENSE team is excited to finally show of our work to the public. We've spent the last week performing final testing of our device, validating the various components we have on board. Thanks to the UW APRIL team (http://tan.uwaterloo.ca), we were able to borrow a flue gas analyzer for validation of our gas sensors!

We're also working hard on finalizing the software side of our demo. Evgeny is using a visualization tool called Grafana to display live data that we collect from three boards at the symposium, which we hope will look pretty awesome. Combined with his database work, the boards we have running will show off the full range of features we've designed, and will mimic a real-world deployment of networked sensor nodes!

With our posters off for printing as well, we're feeling pretty satisfied with our work these last few months, and we look forward to seeing you at our symposium on Friday!
