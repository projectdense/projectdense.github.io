Last week, we made our second PCB orders, after weeks of careful prototyping with the first version.

These new boards feature a ton of changes over the first version, and will be the boards we use for our final demo device and the upcoming symposium in March. Although our V0.1 boards were pretty successful, there were a lot of problems and subsequent workarounds that we've addressed in the V0.2 boards. We've switched out some components, added a few new ones, and made several routing changes. Best of all, we added more LED's to give the board extra cool-factor.

Hopefully, we'll be putting together these boards very soon. Anthony will be working hard to get the mechanical device completed as well, so we should have our demo device ready in the next couple of weeks. Our last key task will be validation of our gas and dust sensors.

We'd also like to give a shout-out to SPEC Sensors, a manufacturer of high quality amperometric gas sensors. We've been using their sensors on our design, and the SPEC team has provided a great deal of assistance to help integrate the sensors properly. They've also agreed to supply further samples to help show off at the symposium! You can check out other SPEC Sensor products at www.spec-sensors.com.
