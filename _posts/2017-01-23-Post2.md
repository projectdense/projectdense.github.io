With our first weekly update, we introduce the entire DENSE team and the project we're working on. For the DENSE project, we've got Evgeny Gorchakov, the software wiz-kid, Adam Rakoff and Antony Zhou, the electrical techies, and Anthony Pasquariello, the mechanical mastermind!

With the DENSE project, our team is looking to reinvent the way air quality monitoring is performed in large urban enviornments. As it stands, air quality researchers spend countless hours developing complex models to try and understand the variability of air quality in a city. So we're introducing a networked sensor node for deployment across a city, collecting real-time data for 24/7 air quality monitoring. With these tools, researchers will be able to more quickly promote legislative change on air quality, paving the way to a healthier living for all residents.

In the last 4 months, we've worked hard to develop our first design for the sensor node. What we've come up with is a solar powered sensor node, powered by an Atmel ATmega32U4 microcontroller, and containing a wide array of gas and particulate matter sensors. We've been working very closely with industry experts along the way, to tailor our device specifically for the very air quality researchers that will be benefitting from them.

In the coming week, we plan on receiving our first PCB prototypes, as well as sensors and components, so that we can have a nice, long prototyping session. We're also preparing for our first mechanical mockups in the weeks after that as well.
