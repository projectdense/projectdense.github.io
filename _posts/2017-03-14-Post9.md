Symposium day has come and gone, and the DENSE team had a wonderful time! Everything went perfectly, and we were proud to present our project to all the people that came out to the event. Thanks to everyone who came to visit our booth!

Thats all from the Project DENSE team for this term though. We've thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience, and are looking forward to graduation in the near future now. Thank you again to all our sponsors and supervisors, and to all the people who assisted us in making our project a huge success!
