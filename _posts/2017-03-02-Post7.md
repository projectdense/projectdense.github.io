Our V0.2 boards arrived this week, along with a few more boxes filled with components, and we had our second prototyping session of the term. This time, we were not only be producing boards for testing, but for use in our symposium, which is fast approaching!

The new boards look quite similar to the V0.1 boards we received over a month ago, and again, we were impressed by the overall quality and turnaround time. The soldering process was quite uneventful, and Adam and Antony were able to get three boards done quite quickly, which Evgeny then quickly verified as well.

There was a minor issue with our radio at first, but that problem was quickly corrected, and so far, we haven't found any more problems with our circuit (fingers crossed that we don't find any). Additionally, the changes we made from the V0.1 board make this new batch of PCBs considerably easier to bootload and program. We've broken out the ICSP header this time, and rearranged components to ensure everything was placed properly. Thus, the V0.2 boards look a lot cleaner, as shown below (V0.1 board is on the left)

With our three demo boards prepared, and our mechanical enclosure almost complete, we're getting very close to being ready for our symposium! The last couple weeks will serve as time to demo our prototype to the department, perform some quick sensor validation, finish up the software, and get our poster ready. For the symposium, we'll be using three demo boards, one of which is fully populated and will sit in the enclosure at our booth, and the other two will be spread around the building, showing off the networked nature of the project!
