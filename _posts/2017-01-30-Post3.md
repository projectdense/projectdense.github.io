Last week, we received our first PCB prototype run! We ordered 10, 2-layer boards from SeeedStudio, complete with silkscreen and solder mask. They look excellent, and we're super impressed with the quality and turnaround time!

So, with our new boards in hand, we spent this past weekend putting them together. As it turns out, some of the components we've selected are a lot smaller than we had expected. The lack of exposed leads and pads on some of the smaller chips made soldering a bit of a challenge. But with some careful hand eye coordination from Adam and Antony, and the help of a hot air gun, the first board was put together.

Then, disaster! The first board we plugged in didn't work. An indicator LED came on to tell us that the battery was low, when in fact no battery was connected. As a result, no power was being supplied to our 3.3 V regulator, and so our microcontroller was left in the dark.

Obviously, we weren't expecting the boards to work perfectly on the first try, but we were really hoping to avoid serious layout issues. So we set about debugging the board, testing voltages at inputs and outputs, pouring over datasheets and reference schematics, and rechecking our own designs. We even opened a ticket with Microchip, who produces the power management component, to see if they had any ideas.

Ultimately, the issue turned out to be rather embarrassing. Our micro-USB connector, used for programming and powering the chip, had either come loose from the board, or had never been soldered properly. In any case, once that was fixed, we were greeted by a different LED indicator, telling us that all was well, and our microcontroller began broadcasting over USB.

With our first technical hurdle overcome, we finished a second board for the week. The first board, equipped with the communication module, would be left for Evgeny so that he could begin software related development. The second board, equipped with the various sensors we would eventually use, would be used by Adam and Antony for further component verification. We also have a list of changes, a work in progress, based on our first prototyping run, which will dictate the design of our next PCB version.

In the upcoming week, we hope to solidify our plan for the enclosure design, as well as source parts for batteries and solar panels. On the software side, we will need to figure out how we can burn a bootloader and begin flashing our own programs to the chip.
