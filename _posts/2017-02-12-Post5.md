We have a mechanical design!  Now that the PCB size is fixed and most of the components are decided on (and more importantly their sizes) completion of the node assembly can be completed. The mechanical design was kept simple to allow it to be easily assembled in as little time as possible. The enclosure has two main parts the lid and the box, where all the components and PCB will sit. The box contains features that nicely seat the components as well as prevent any water from entering the enclosure. To do this a double layer channel on the bottom of the box was used that will allow air to freely flow while preventing water from entering. Also a rubber gasket will be used to tightly seal the lid to the box.

The next step in the coming weeks is to print the design and then assemble and test it. The design of the enclosure will be an iterative process to work out any design flaws that may arise during testing.
