In the wake of rapid urbanization, a growing focus by municipalities is on addressing urban air quality, a huge factor in civilian health and quality of life. Unfortunately, researchers currently rely on a handful of permanent monitoring stations, coupled with developing complex models, in order to understand air quality variability in a city.  The DENSE team aims to develop a scalable, self-sustaining, low cost device for monitoring of gas and dust based pollutants, which can be quickly deployed in large urban environments.
